    Here you need to register all the fonts you want to use inside your
    presentation. You technically need two font-files though: one for regular
    text and one for bold text (except if you don't want bold text, then you
    can just reuse the normal font). Here's how you would register a font:

    "NAME": ["PATH_TO_REGULAR_FONT", "PATH_TO_BOLD_FONT"]

    (replace NAME with the name of the font; that's what you'll set any 'font'-
    fields to)
